Create three new HTML files and save them in the new folder as "index1.html", "index2.html", and "index3.html".
Edit each of the files in order and complete the following tasks, using internal CSS style sheets:

# index1.html:

Change the title to be "Indian Flag".
Create a div with width of 400px, height of 80 pixels, and a deep saffron background.
Beneath that, create a div with the same dimensions and white background.
Beneath that, create another div with the same dimensions and green background.

# index2.html:

Change the title to be "Romanian Flag".
Create a div that is 240px high by 133px wide. Make the background yellow.
Set the top margin to be 100px and the left margin to be 50px.
Add a solid blue 133px left border and a solid red 133px right border.

# index3.html:

Change the title to be "Hot Air Balloon".
Create a div that is 300px wide by 375px high.
Place the balloon.jpg (already added to your project) inside the div.
Set the top and left margins to be 100px and add a 5 pixel wide red dashed border to the div.
Add 10px of padding to the top and bottom and 5px padding to the right and left around the image.


Finally create 3 links in index.html file to navigate to other three files.
